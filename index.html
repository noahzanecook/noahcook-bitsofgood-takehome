                <h3>Intro</h3>
                <p>Hello! My name is Noah Cook, and I am a second year at Georgia Tech. I am studying Computer Science with a concentration in Intelligence and Theory, and I am currently in Georgia Tech's Create-X Program. Use the tabs above to read more about me!</p>

              <div id="Background" class="tabcontent">
                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p>I was born and raised in Southeast Georgia around the Okefenokee Swamp. Since a young age I have been tinkering with computers, and self-studying game development was my intro to CS. Since then I have worked in IT, done ML research, and recently got into web development!</p>

                <h3>Hobbies</h3>
                <p>In my spare time I like to read, work on personal projects, and hang out with friends. I am excited to watch the College Football National Championship, and I am hoping GT will make it to the play-offs next year haha.</p>
